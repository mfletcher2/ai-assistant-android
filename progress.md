### Week 1 (Nov. 17)
Created a simple messaging screen by following the [Android Jetpack Compose tutorial](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial). I chose to use Compose because I saw Google pushing it a ton on the Android developer website. It must be good, right? So far I think it looks really nice with minimal configuration, and it's nice not to have to deal with a ton of XML tags.
